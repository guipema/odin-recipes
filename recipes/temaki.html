        <li>Sea salt to taste</li>
            
        <li>1 ½ cups Japanese or sushi rice</li>
            
        <li>2 cups water</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
            
        <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds, plus more for garnish</li>
            
        <li>½ teaspoon sesame oil</li>
            
        <li>½ teaspoon togarashi or 1 teaspoon sriracha, or to taste</li>
            
        <li>2 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced</li>
            
        <li>2 Persian cucumbers, cut into ¼-inch matchsticks</li>
            
        <li>1 ripe Hass avocado, cut into ¼-inch slices</li>
            
        <li>4 full-size sheets of nori (Japanese seaweed)</li>
            
        <li>Soy sauce, wasabi, pickled ginger for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step-By-Step</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>MAKE THE RICE
            In a small bowl, combine the vinegar, the sugar, and a pinch of salt, stirring to dissolve. In a medium saucepan, combine the rice with 2 cups of water and let sit for 10 minutes. Bring to a boil, then cover and cook over low heat until the liquid is absorbed, 15 to 17 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside for 10 minutes. Spread the rice on a large platter and toss with the sweetened vinegar. Refrigerate briefly just until cool.</li>
            
        <li>MAKE THE SUSHI
            Meanwhile, combine the salmon burger, mayonnaise, sesame seeds, and sesame oil, and season with salt and as much togarashi or sriracha as desired.
            
            Prepare the nori. Stack the sheets and cut in half lengthwise into rectangles. Over a gas flame, quickly swipe the nori sheets over the burner to lightly toast.
            
            Working with 1 piece at a time, set the nori on a cutting board, shiny side down, with the long edge facing the bottom. Spread ¼ cup of the rice on the left half. Add 2 tablespoons of the salmon mixture in a strip down the center of the rice and top with a few pieces of scallion, cucumber, and avocado. To roll, bring the short left side up to meet the top and roll into a cone shape. Crush a few rice grains on the inside corner and press to close the roll. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Serve with soy, wasabi, and pickled ginger.</li>
